# European Option Pricer – Black–Scholes and Monte Carlo

This project implements a simple European call and put option pricer using the **Black–Scholes equation**, alongside a **Monte Carlo simulation** to illustrate convergence towards the analytical solution.

## Features
- Black–Scholes formula for European call and put options
- Monte Carlo simulation for numerical approximation
- Convergence plots comparing Monte Carlo results to the theoretical price
- Log-scaled simulation count for performance visualization

## Requirements
This project uses Python with the following dependencies:
```bash
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
